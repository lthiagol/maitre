The upstream `agents/openai.yaml` files are **not** vendored — they configure a
different harness.

## Rules for vendored copies

1. **Pinned to a commit.** Never `main`. v1 vendored at `main` and both copies drifted.
2. **Byte-identical to upstream.** No edits in place. A skill that needs changing for
   maitre becomes ours, under `templates/skills/`.
3. **Re-sync by script.** `skills/sync.sh` prints a diff before overwriting.
4. **Record the commit.** This file is the provenance; the commit hash is the pin.
